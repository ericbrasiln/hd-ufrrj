# Notes

Objetivo principal:

“In this article, I argue why historians, no matter if their subfield, needs to be able to question the economics, policies and systems design of digital archives. To that end, I offer a framework for supporting a professional reflection on the ‘everyday use’ of digital archives and the powerful forces that shape online content and availability.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 1)

Enconding/deconding model (Stuart Hall):

“a critical exploration of how the production, distribution and circulation of media (in this case, digital archives) influence signifying practices and interpretation (here, historical research).” (Jensen, 2021, p. 1)

A autora argumenta que a mudança de arquivos analógicos para digitais ‘é uma mudança de meio que estabelece um novo conjunto de lógicas para a produção, conteúdo, distribuição e uso dos arquivos’, portanto:

“Without knowledge about the economic, political and technical aspects of digital archives, users are in the dark when it comes to questioning how digital archives act as co-producers of historical research. Recent work by scholars in Information Science confirms the problem as they found that a majority of historians are using digital archives’ research tools (finding aids, search engines, catalogues, etc.),8 but seldom consider their impact on methodology.9” (Jensen, 2021, p. 2)

“The quality of historical research depends on an understanding of these logics because they have methodological consequences.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 2)

## Understanding Archives

O foco da autora recai sobre “arquivos bem estabelecidos”, como arquivos nacionais, coleções especiais e instituições similares (2). Os financiamentos, as formas de acesso às fontes são bastante diferentes se comparadas às fontes analógicas. (3)

“The types of sources that are available online are very limited compared to what can be found on location. Still, their online presence makes them a thousand times easier to find. The perceived familiarity these digital collections’ project, which exists only on the surface, nevertheless lead users to believe that dealing with the analogue and the digital collections in these institutions is the same.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 3)

## The Archive as Medium (p. 3)

“Archives are, when they become available online, part of a digital cyberinfrastructure. When archival institutions produce collections, they become part of a digital landscape with its particular logic of production and distribution. This shapes the archive as a cultural form, as a medium, and it means that the framework needs to prompt critical reflections on the institutional, technical and user-oriented aspects related to digital archives.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 3)

Modelo de Stuart Hall:

“conceptualises the entirety of mediated communication as creating meaning at all points in the cultural circuit. In short, it can help us to understand the totality of the new ways archives co-produce history when they become digital. In the Cultural Studies tradition being ‘media literate’ means understanding the many factors that influence media consumption.11 In the case of digital archives, this entails knowing how they affect what users find and perceive the digitised sources.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 3)

## When Digitisation Becomes Popularisation

Primeiro passo para a “digital archive literacy”: “compreender como as diferenças na produção de arquivos analógicos e digitais afetam a disponibilidade das fontes” (3-4)

Arquivo analógico: todas as fontes estão disponíveis do mesmo modo (algumas estão inacessíveis, mas isso recebe a reflexão do pesquisador) Instrumentos de busca ajudam a ‘navegar’ entre as coleções e entender suas estruturas.

Arquivos Digitais: acesso e disponibilidade são distintas em função da seleção e re-categorização que acontece no processo de digitalização.

“Ou seja, mesmo que mantidas pela mesmas instituições, coleções digitais e analógicas representam duas lógicas diferentes para sua disponibilização.” (p. 4)

“The production of digital archives is, in many cases, about making more widely available what is (already) popular. This different logic of archival production means that historians always need to consider what they are (not) likely to find online, and what it means to their work.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 4)

Arquivos “tradicionais” estão se tornando mais focados no usuário, o que leva a um política de digitalização que privilegia coleções com demandas de acesso mais elevadas. Sobretudo diante do fato de dependerem de financiamento externo.

Ao mesmo tempo, empresas privadas  tem se tornado importantes “players”, e fazem parte dessa “cyberinfrastructure onde o conteúdo disponibilizado representa possibilidade de lucro” (4)

“Africanists, media and gender historians, and people working with decolonial Digital Humanities, have pointed out that digitisation may become a driver for re-traditionalising history because external funders only want to pay for what is already popular.17 If historians at large are not aware of this dynamic, they have no way of addressing the issue in question; how it biases research in their (sub)-fields or their individual research.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 5)

## The Economy of Digital Archives

“Using digital archives for our research, we must, therefore, ask the same questions of digital as analogue archives: what can I expect to find and how does it affect my research as well as the historiography to which I am contributing?” (Jensen, 2021, p. 5)

“It is therefore essential to consider how being embedded in a wider cyberinfrastructure affects the design of the entire system of digital archives.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 6)

## Questionning Systems Design

“Digital archival literacy requires understanding how the production of digital archives builds on technical designs that influence their usability.20 This means that (all) historians need to acquire digital competence on a professional level parallel to the skills that we have in understanding how classification and categorisation of sources affect our interaction with analogue archives and shape our research questions. If researchers use digital archives, they must understand (and teach) how different system designs impact finding and working with sources, because in the digital archive the only access to the sources is through its interface. One cannot avoid the technical infrastructure of the archive as it mediates all interaction with the items it contains.” (Jensen, 2021, p. 6)

Três aspectos gerais do design dos sistemas de arquivo digital que historiadores precisam tomar consciência para compreender como eles podem agir como co-produtores da pesquisa histórica:

1. Predefined subject categories
2. Searching via search fields and sorting of results
3. Understanding the importance of metadata
